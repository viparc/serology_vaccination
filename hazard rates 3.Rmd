From Juan:

The first thing we asked you to help us on calculating the hazard rate for each
disease among unvaccinated flocks (regardless of vaccine use). You only need age,
and serological result (positive and negative). This will help us rank the
diseases by their observed circulation level.

The next analyses is to build models with disease as outcome and vaccination as
a covariate (to see whether vaccination reduces probability of clinical disease).

Other model should look at titres as outcome and investigate whether the symptoms
typical of each disease are associated with a higher titre. This would confirm
disease circulation.
-->

## Summary

Here we first look at the relationship between vaccination and seroprevalence.
Out of the 8 pathogens for which we have serological data, 5 have vaccination.
None of these 5 pathogens showed a significant effect of vaccination on the
seroprevalence. The analysis was done by correcting for the age of the chicken
that tested for serology. Then, for the 8 pathogens, we characterized the trend
in seroprevalence as a function of age. 6 did not show any significant trend as
a function of age. Seroprevalence was significantly increasing with age for IBV
and MG only.

In a second analysis we look at the relationship between vaccination and the
prevalence of symptoms of respiratory infections, diarrhoea, CNS infections and
sudden death. The prevalences of these 4 symptoms significantly decrease with
age. The effect of the 6 vaccines on these four symptoms are somewhat puzzling
in the sense that some vaccines do not have any effect on the symptoms that they
are supposed to decrease. In some situations, they even increase them instead of
decreasing them! Furthermore, other vaccines that are not supposed to have any
effect on some symptoms do significantly increase and decrease them. This
suggests either that the correspondance between the symptoms and the pathogens
that are targeted by the vaccines is way too loose in this system or that there
are other  factors at play that we didn't take into account into our analysis
(e.g. AMU). The summary of the effects is detailed below:

* **respiratory infections:** NDV and IBD significantly decrease the prevalence
of symptoms of respiratory infections as we could expect (although not so much)
but HPASI and IBV vaccine on the contrary significanlty increase the prevalence
of symptols of respiratory infections. Furthermore, FP and PM which are not
supposed to have any effect on the prevalence of respiratory infections
significantly increase the prevalence of symptoms of respiratory infections.

* **sudden death:** HPAI significantly decrease the prevalence of sudden death
as we could explect but NDV and PM fail in doing so. Surprisingly, FP decreases
the prevalence of sudden death whereas IBV, on the contrary, increases it.

* **diarrhoea:** IBD decreases the prevalence of diarrhoea as expected and is
the vaccine that does so the most. Surprisingly, IBV and PM also decrease the
prevalence of diarrhoea but to a lesser extent than IBD. Still surprinsingly, 
HPAI increases the prevalence of diarrhoea.

* **CNS infections:** NDV increases the prevalence of CNS a lot whereas it's
supposed to decrease it on the contrary. PM also increases the prevalence of CNS
whereas it's not supposed to have an effect. Surprisingly, IBV decreases the
prevalence of CNS whereas it's not supposed to have any effect on CNS.

## Packages

The required packages:

```{r}
required_packages <- c("dplyr", "magrittr", "purrr", "readr", "readxl", "tibble")
to_install <- setdiff(required_packages, rownames(installed.packages()))
if (length(to_install)) install.packages(to_install)
```

Laoding the packages for interactive use:

```{r}
library(magrittr)
```

## Loading and exploring the serological data

Let's load and transform the data

```{r}
serodata <- readxl::read_excel("SeroData.xlsx") %>% 
  dplyr::mutate_at("Weight.Kg.", as.numeric) %>% 
  dplyr::mutate_at(dplyr::vars(dplyr::starts_with("Sero")), as.logical) %>% 
  dplyr::mutate_at(dplyr::vars(dplyr::ends_with("vaccinated")), as.logical) %>% 
  dplyr::rename(age = `Age(Week)`)
```

Number of observations:

```{r}
nrow(serodata)
```

Number of unique flocks:

```{r}
length(unique(serodata$FlockID))
```

(i.e. one observation per flock). Number of farms:

```{r}
length(unique(serodata$`Farm ID`))
```

Number of flocks per farm:

```{r}
serodata %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(`Farm ID`) %>% 
  dplyr::tally() %>% 
  purrr::pluck("n") %>% 
  table()
```

Ages:

```{r}
hist(serodata$age, col = "grey", main = NA, xlab = "age (weeks)", ylab = "number of chicken")
```

Weights:

```{r}
hist(serodata$Weight.Kg., col = "grey", main = NA, xlab = "weight (kg)", ylab = "number of chicken")
```

No correlation between age and weight:

```{r}
summary(lm(Weight.Kg. ~ age, serodata))
```

Visually:

```{r}
with(serodata, plot(age, Weight.Kg., xlab = "age (weeks)", ylab = "weight (kg)"))
```

Flock sizes:

```{r}
hist(serodata$Farmsize, col = "grey", xlab = "farm size (nb of chickens)", ylab = "number of chicken")
```

No correlation between farm size and weight:

```{r}
summary(lm(Weight.Kg. ~ Farmsize, serodata))
with(serodata, plot(Farmsize, Weight.Kg., xlab = "farm size (nb of chickens)", ylab = "weight (kg)"))
```

But age seems to increase with farm size:

```{r}
summary(lm(age ~ Farmsize, serodata))
```

Visually:

```{r}
mod <- loess(age ~ Farmsize, serodata)
x_val <- with(serodata, seq(min(Farmsize), max(Farmsize), le = 512))
pred <- predict(mod, data.frame(Farmsize = x_val), se = TRUE)
y_val <- with(pred, c(fit + qt(.025, Inf) * se.fit, rev(fit + qt(.975, Inf) * se.fit)))
with(serodata, plot(Farmsize, age, xlab = "farm size (nb of chickens)",
                    ylab = "age (weeks)",
                    ylim = c(min(c(age, y_val)), max(c(age, y_val)))))
polygon(c(x_val, rev(x_val)), y_val, col = adjustcolor("blue", .1), border = NA)
lines(x_val, pred$fit, col = "blue")
```

## Effect of vaccinations on seroprevalence against pathogens

### Making the data

The following function makes a data frame for a given disease `var`, with 3
columns: `age`, `seropositive` and `vaccinated`:

```{r}
make_data <- function(var) {
  a <- dplyr::select(serodata, age, dplyr::contains(var))
  sel <- grep("vaccinated", names(a))
  if (length(sel) > 0) {
    setNames(a, c("age", "seropositive", "vaccinated"))
  }
  dplyr::mutate(a, vaccinated = FALSE) %>% 
    setNames(c("age", "seropositive", "vaccinated"))
}
```

The 8 pathogens:

```{r}
(vars <- sub("Sero.", "", grep("Sero", names(serodata), value = TRUE)))
```

Making the data sets for all the pathogens:

```{r}
datasets <- setNames(lapply(vars, make_data), vars)
```

Checking which pathogens have vaccination:

```{r}
(vaccinated <- datasets %>% 
  sapply(function(x) length(unique(unlist(x[, "vaccinated"]))) > 1))
```

### Modeling the data

Methods: for the 5 pathogens for which we have both serological and vaccination
data we use a logistic regression the look at the effect of age, vaccination
status and interaction on the seroprevalence. Since none of these models show a
significant effect of vaccination status, we then use logistic regressions to
look at the effects of age on seroprevalence of the 8 pathogens. Only 2 (IBV and
MG) show a significant increase of seroprevalence as a function of age with
levels close to zero at hatching. Only for these two we perform extrapolation
over the whole life time of the chicken. For the 6 other pathogen for which
seroprevalence does not depend on age we don't do interpolation over the age
range for which we have data since we have no clue to know whether the oberved
level of seroprevalence is reach after a quick increased from zero or was
already as such at hatching.

The models:

```{r}
models <- lapply(datasets[vaccinated], function(x) glm(seropositive ~ age * vaccinated, binomial, x))
```

The coefficients estimations:

```{r}
sapply(models, coef)
```

The significativities of age and vaccination on seropositivity against the 5
pathogens against which there is a vaccine:

```{r}
models %>%
  sapply(function(x) anova(x, test = "LRT")$`Pr(>Chi)`) %>%
  `[`(-1, ) %>%
  `rownames<-`(c("age", "vaccinated", "age:vaccinated"))
```

The only disease for which vaccination may have a slight effect is PM, but, not
only the effect of vaccination would be small, it wouldn't even be in the right
directions...

```{r}
predict2 <- function(x) {
  require(magrittr)
  linkinv <- family(x)$linkinv
  ages <- x$data$age
  age_val <- seq(min(ages), max(ages), le = 512)
  predict(x, data.frame(age = age_val), se.fit = TRUE) %>% 
    data.frame() %>% 
    dplyr::mutate(lower = linkinv(fit + qt(.025, Inf) * se.fit),
                  upper = linkinv(fit + qt(.975, Inf) * se.fit),
                  fit   = linkinv(fit),
                  age   = age_val) %>% 
    dplyr::select(-residual.scale, -se.fit)
}
```

Let's now focus on the effect of age on seroprevalence for all the pathogens:

```{r}
models <- lapply(datasets, function(x) glm(seropositive ~ age, binomial, x))
```

Let's compute additional data for predictions:

```{r}
linkinv <- family(models[[1]])$linkinv
age_val1 <- seq(min(serodata$age), max(serodata$age), le = 512)
age_val2 <- seq(0, min(serodata$age), le = 512)
age_val3 <- range(serodata$age)
newdata1 <- data.frame(age = age_val1)
newdata2 <- data.frame(age = age_val2)
age_pol1 <- c(age_val1, rev(age_val1))
age_pol2 <- c(age_val2, rev(age_val2))
age_pol3 <- c(age_val3, rev(age_val3))
```

The following function uses a model as an input and computes a data frame with
512 rows and 4 columns: one for age, one for predicted seroprevalence and the
last two for the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval:

```{r}
predict2 <- function(x, newdata) {
  require(magrittr)
  predict(x, newdata, se.fit = TRUE) %>% 
    data.frame() %>% 
    dplyr::mutate(lower = linkinv(fit + qt(.025, Inf) * se.fit),
                  upper = linkinv(fit + qt(.975, Inf) * se.fit),
                  fit   = linkinv(fit)) %>% 
    dplyr::select(-residual.scale, -se.fit)
}
```

This function does the same as `predict2()` but in case there is no significant
relationship with age:

```{r}
constant <- function(x) {
  with(with(x,
            binom.test(sum(seropositive), length(seropositive))),
       c(estimate, conf.int))
}
```

Let's look at the significativities of the age effects:

```{r}
sapply(models, function(x) coef(summary(x))[2, "Pr(>|z|)"])
```

Age effect on PM after correction for multiple testing does not even remain
significant:

```{r}
length(models) * sapply(models, function(x) coef(summary(x))[2, "Pr(>|z|)"])
```

Identifying the pathogens for which seroprevalence significantly increases with
age:

```{r}
(ages_signif <- sapply(models, function(x) coef(summary(x))[2, "Pr(>|z|)"]) < .05 / length(models))
```

Computing the models predictions, interpolation for the models where age effect
is significant:

```{r}
predictions1 <- lapply(models, predict2, newdata1)
```

Extrapolation for the models where age effect is significant:

```{r}
predictions2 <- lapply(models, predict2, newdata2)
```

Interpolation for the models where the age effect is not significant:

```{r}
predictions3 <- lapply(datasets, constant)
```

This function plots the model predictions in case the age effect is significant:

```{r}
plot_pred1 <- function(x, y) {
  plot(age_val1, x$fit, xlim = c(0, 25), ylim = 0:1, type = "n",
       xlab = "age (weeks)", ylab = "seroprevalence")
  polygon(age_pol1, c(x$lower, rev(x$upper)), col = adjustcolor("blue", .2), border = NA)
  lines(age_val1, x$fit, col = "blue")
  lines(age_val1, x$lower, col = adjustcolor("blue", .2))
  lines(age_val1, x$upper, col = adjustcolor("blue", .2))
  polygon(age_pol2, c(y$lower, rev(y$upper)), 30, 135, NA, col = adjustcolor("blue", .2))
  lines(age_val2, y$lower, col = adjustcolor("blue", .2))
  lines(age_val2, y$upper, col = adjustcolor("blue", .2))
  lines(age_val2, y$fit, col = "blue", lty = 2)
}
```

where `x` and `y` are the interpolation and extrapolation predictions
respectively. The following function plots the model interpolation predictions
in case the age effect is not significant:

```{r}
plot_pred2 <- function(x) {
  plot(age_val3, rep(x[1], 2), xlim = c(0, 25), ylim = 0:1,
       type = "n", xlab = "age (weeks)", ylab = "seroprevalence")
  polygon(age_pol3, x[c(2, 2, 3, 3)], col = adjustcolor("blue", .2), border = NA)
  lines(age_val3, rep(x[1], 2), col = "blue")
  lines(age_val3, rep(x[2], 2), col = adjustcolor("blue", .2))
  lines(age_val3, rep(x[3], 2), col = adjustcolor("blue", .2))
}
```

Plotting the models' predictions:

```{r fig.height = 4, fig.width = 9}
opar <- par(mfrow = c(2, 4), cex = .83, plt = c(.2, .85, .2, .85))
for (i in seq_along(vars)) {
  if (ages_signif[i]) plot_pred1(predictions1[[i]], predictions2[[i]])
  else plot_pred2(predictions3[[i]])
  mtext(vars[i], line = 0)
}
par(opar)
```

where the areas represent the 95% confidence interval (for extrapolation when
hatched and for interpolation when full color). Extrapolations are shown only in
cases where age effect is significant. Indeed, when age effect is not
significant we have not much clue to know whether the level plateau corresponds
to a level that has been reached after an icreased for which we don't have data
or to a level that was constant since hatching.

## Effect of vaccinations on symptoms prevalences

### Making the data

Loading the ViParc data for the week and the symptoms information:

```{r}
viparc <- readr::read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/viparc/clires_data/master/data/viparc.csv",
                          col_types = paste(c("ciillidddllllll", rep("d", 45)), collapse = "")) %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(FlockID = paste0(farm, flock))
```

Laoding the data on the timings of vaccination:

```{r}
fig1 <- readr::read_csv("Figure1.csv", col_types = "cdddddddc") %>% 
  dplyr::select(-CODE) %>%
  dplyr::mutate_if(is.numeric, as.integer) %>% 
  dplyr::arrange(WEEKNO)
```

The following function splits the information on a given vaccine by flock:

```{r}
g <- function(vacc_name) {
  fig1[, c("FlockID", "WEEKNO", vacc_name)] %>% 
  unique() %>% 
  split(.$FlockID)
}
```

The following function recodes, for a data frame containing the vaccination
information of a given flock, the vaccination information with `FALSE` for the
weeks before vaccination and `TRUE` for the weeks after vaccination:

```{r}
f <- function(df) {
  vacc_names <- grep("vaccinated", names(df))
  out <- setNames(data.frame(df$FlockID[1], seq_len(max(df$WEEKNO)), 0L, stringsAsFactors = FALSE), names(df))
  first <- which(df[, vacc_names] > 0)[1]
  if (is.na(first)) return(out)
  out[first:nrow(out), vacc_names] <- 1L
  out
}
```

Using the 2 datasets and the 2 functions defined above to generate the dataset
for our analysis:

```{r}
(vacc_data <- names(fig1) %>%
  setdiff(c("FlockID", "WEEKNO")) %>% 
  lapply(g) %>% 
  lapply(function(x) dplyr::bind_rows(lapply(x, f))) %>% 
  purrr::reduce(dplyr::left_join, c("FlockID", "WEEKNO")) %>% 
  dplyr::left_join(viparc, "FlockID") %>% 
  dplyr::select(farm, flock, week, respiratory, diarrhoea, cns, sudden_death, ends_with("vaccinated")) %>% 
  dplyr::mutate_at(dplyr::vars(dplyr::ends_with("vaccinated")), as.logical) %>% 
  tibble::as_tibble())
```

### Modeling the data

Methods: here we combine two data sets for the analysis: The first one gives the
timings of vaccination and the second one give the presence of symptoms. The
timing information is transformed into a boolean vector that says, for each week
of each flock, whether we are before or after vaccination against a particular
pathogen. Then, we use logistic regression to model, for each symptom of
interest, the effect of being before or after vaccination for all the vaccines,
as well age. The results show that, in absence of vaccination, the prevalences
of symptoms significantly decrease with age. When accounting for this age
effect, as well as correcting for multiple tests, there are a number of
vaccination effects that are significant but not always in a way that is
expected. This is detailed below and in the summary at the top of this document.

Estimating logistic regressions, one for each of the 4 symptoms:

```{r}
vaccine_names <- grep("vaccinated", names(vacc_data), value = TRUE)
symptoms <- c("respiratory", "sudden_death", "diarrhoea", "cns")
models <- setNames(lapply(
  paste(symptoms, "~", paste(c("week", vaccine_names), collapse = "+")),
  function(x) glm(as.formula(x), binomial, vacc_data)), symptoms)
```

The coefficients of the 4 models:

```{r}
(coeff <- sapply(models, coef))
```

The confidence intervals of the coefficients of the 4 models:

```{r}
coeff_ci <- lapply(models, confint)
```

The significativities of the effects for the 4 models, corrected for potential
confounding effects:

```{r}
models %>%
  sapply(function(x) car::Anova(x, test = "LR")$`Pr(>Chisq)`) %>%
  round(4) %>% 
  `rownames<-`(rownames(coeff)[-1])
```

Correcting for multiple tests:

```{r}
models %>%
  sapply(function(x) car::Anova(x, test = "LR")$`Pr(>Chisq)`) %>%
  round(4) %>% 
  `rownames<-`(rownames(coeff)[-1]) %>% 
  `*`(length(.))
```


The link inverse function of the models:

```{r}
linkinv <- family(models[[1]])$linkinv
```

Generating some new data for the models predictions:

```{r}
newdata <- data.frame(week = seq(min(vacc_data$week), max(vacc_data$week), le = 512),
                      Fowl.Pox.vaccinated = FALSE, HPAI.vaccinated = FALSE,
                      NDV.vaccinated = FALSE, IBV.vaccinated = FALSE,
                      IBD.vaccinated = FALSE, PM.vaccinated = FALSE)
```

The following function takes a model as an input and returns a data frame with
3 columns: predicted value and the lower and upper bounds of the confidence
interval of the predictions:

```{r}
predict2 <- function(x) {
  require(magrittr)
  predict(x, newdata, se.fit = TRUE) %>% 
    data.frame() %>% 
    tibble::as_tibble() %>% 
    dplyr::mutate(lower = linkinv(fit + qt(.025, Inf) * se.fit),
                  upper = linkinv(fit + qt(.975, Inf) * se.fit),
                  fit   = linkinv(fit)) %>% 
    dplyr::select(-residual.scale, -se.fit)
}
```

Generating the models' predictions:

```{r}
predictions <- lapply(models, predict2)
```

Reformatting the diseases names:

```{r}
leg <- names(predictions) %>% 
  sub("_", " ", .) %>% 
  sub("cns", "CNS infections", .) %>% 
  sub("y", "y infections", .)
```

The prevalences of the diseases as functions of age:

```{r}
cols <- c("#e41a1c", "#377eb8", "#4daf4a", "#984ea3")
fills <- adjustcolor(cols, .2)
x <- newdata$week
x_val <- c(x, rev(x))
plot(x, predictions[[1]]$fit, ylim = c(0,.17), type = "n", xlab = "age (weeks)",
     ylab = "average prevalence")
for (i in seq_along(predictions)) {
  polygon(x_val, c(predictions[[i]]$lower, rev(predictions[[i]]$upper)), 
          col = fills[i], border = NA)
  lines(x, predictions[[i]]$fit, col = cols[i])
}
legend("topright", legend = leg, fill = fills, col = cols, lty = 1, bty = "n", border = NA)
```

The effects of the vaccines on the prevalences of the diseases:

```{r fig.height = 2, fig.width = 10}
xs <- 1:6
ys <- c(1 / seq(0, 10, 1), 1 + seq(0, 10, 1))
f <- function(x) log2(exp(x))

opar <- par(mfrow = c(1, 4), plt = c(.2, 1, .05, .95))

for (i in seq_along(coeff_ci)) {
  plot(xs, f(coeff[-(1:2), i]), pch = 19, xlim = c(0, 7), ylim = c(-3.1, 3.1),
       axes = FALSE, xlab = NA, ylab = "odds ratio")
  axis(2, log2(ys), ys)
  text(3.5, 2.5, leg[i])
#  text(xs, -2.5, c("NDV", "HPAI", "PM", "IBV", "IBD", "FP"))
  text(xs, -2.5, c("FP", "HPAI", "NDV", "IBV", "IBD", "PM"))
  arrows(xs, f(coeff_ci[[i]][-(1:2), 1]), xs, f(coeff_ci[[i]][-(1:2), 2]), .05, 90, 3)
  abline(h = 0, lty = 2)
}
par(opar)
```

Note that all those for which the confidence interval touchs the 1 line are not
significant after correction for multiple tests. All the other ones are
significant.
